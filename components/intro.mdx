This is a collection of real Hack Club meetings run by real club
leaders, paired with everything you need to run them in your own Hack
Club. In each Meeting, you'll find: - A full recording of a real Hack
Club meeting - Step-by-step instructions for running the same meeting
in your own club - All resources used to run this meeting (workshops,
slides, etc.) If you're new to leading a Hack Club and are struggling
to get started, these may be a very useful resource to you. If you're
an experienced club leader, these are a way to discover new activities
for your club, and/or check out how other club leaders are running
club meetings. More Meetings will be added in the coming weeks. For
now, consider this program to be "in beta". If you have any feedback,
or want to add your own Meeting, please DM me on Slack

hacking! ✨🚀👁 Matthew
