If you have previously run club meetings in person, and are now running meetings online, you may have found that keeping the energy up in online meetings is way harder than it is for in-person meetings. There's a certain "magic" to being in-person that makes it a lot easier to keep people engaged.

Claire is a club leader at an online high school in California, so she's been running online meetings since before the COVID-19 pandemic forced the rest of us to do so. Because of this, she's learned how to overcome the traditional obstacles standing in the way of running great online meetings. In this meeting, she's able to masterfully control the energy in the room and create an incredibly fun experience.

## What Claire does right

What Claire does in this meeting isn't magic; in fact, it's pretty easy to run the exact same meeting in your own club. Broadly, here a few tactics she employs in order to keep the energy high:

- She made a beautiful slideshow for this meeting, and she's sharing her screen on the slideshow for the entire meeting. This is surprisingly effective, because it gives people something to look at as the workshop is going on. If a club member were to stop looking at the slides, they would feel lost—so people stay engaged.
- She frequently pauses to ask questions, e.g. "Here's a piece of code—what would happen if I did x?"
  - See a great example of this from **27:25** to **30:05** in the recording
  - See a more simple example at **13:36** in the recording
- She encouraged everyone to keep their microphones unmuted at the beginning (**2:22**). Less than half of the club members actually unmuted their mics, but even that seemed to be enough to keep the energy up throughout.
- When there's a long period of silence, Claire has a bunch of conversation starters, random tangents, or stories ready to go.
  - The short corn maze story at **43:02** is a good little example of this
  - Another great example of where this worked is at **38:50** in the recording (even though Claire didn't initiate that one)
- Claire herself is super high energy

## Notes

- Slideshows make for great additions to club meetings, if done right. "Doing it right" means 2 things:
  - The slideshow contains mostly pictures and some code, but very little text. It should serve more as a visual aid rather than a "presentation"
  - The slideshow looks fun and is presented in a way that doesn't feel like a class. You should never read off the slide.
- Don't be afraid to go off on unrelated tangents. They will make your meeting take longer to get through, but it can be a great way to take a break from the work, get your club members to know each other, and keep the energy up.
